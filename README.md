Previous Projects' Code

Many of my previous projects used proprietary data of minors involved in foster care. While I am unable to share those datasets, I made my code available to demonstrate proficiency in statistical coding and progress as a coder over time.

Code included here has been redacted and edited to protect the privacy of this vulnerable group and to conform with sharing restrictions and data security. I have several files that I'm working to redact so check back frequently if interested. 

Some code here resulted in analyses used for peer-reviewed publications and is commented as such at the beginning of the file. A list of those publications can be found [here](https://github.com/spinellitr/spinellitr/blob/main/Publications.md). Other code is relevant to publications in progress or ongoing projects. All research ideas embedded in the code here are intellectual property of Tawny Spinelli and identified collaborators.
