Previous Projects' Code

Many of my previous projects used proprietary data of minors involved in foster care. While I am unable to share those datasets, I made my code available to demonstrate proficiency in statistical coding and progress as a coder over time.

Code included here has been redacted and edited to protect the privacy of this vulnerable group and to conform with sharing restrictions and data security. 

Some code here resulted in analyses used for peer-reviewed publications and is commented as such at the beginning of the file. Other code is relevant to publications in progress or ongoing projects. All research ideas embedded in the code here are intellectual property of Tawny Spinelli and identified collaborators.
